# Frosty

Frosty is an experimental raytracer, written in Go.

It was written for the experience of creating a raytracer, not as a serious project.

Status: It makes a picture. Pre-pre-alpha.

## TODO:

- MVP:
  - ~~Cubes~~
  - Light source
  - Shadows
  - Color clamping
- ~~Antialiasing~~
- ~~Parallelism~~
- Background (planes)
- Spheres
- Reflection
- Refraction
- Video

## Ponies

- Tone mapping
- Depth of field
- Motion blur
  - Stochastic temporal sampling
- Adaptive supersampling for faster antialiasing
  - Stochastic supersampling
- Soft shadows
- More shapes
  - Cones
  - Cylinders
  - Toroids
  - Convex polyhedra
  - CSG
- Import models
  - STL?
- Photon mapping (caustics)
- Spatial subdivision (octrees, BSP)
